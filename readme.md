# Introduction - 
This Data Analytics/Data Engineering project involves normalizing and denormalizing existing data for various purposes. A comprehensive data model has been created and visualized to guide the process. The transformation steps required to establish the data model have been executed using Google Cloud Dataproc and PySpark for distributed data processing, instead of the previously planned approach of using Pandas and Mage on a Google Cloud VM. Analytical queries have been written using SQL on BigQuery to analyze the transformed data. Through employing SQL joins, the essential data has been denormalized specifically for the project's dashboard requirements. The final step in this project involves creating an analytics dashboard to visualize and present the denormalized data insights.
